# Hardening-Labs README
This section documents my hands-on experience in securing operating systems and applications against unauthorized access and exploitation in accordinance with the modern standards and frameworks.

  ### Frameworks & Standards
    My approach to system hardening is grounded in:
      * **NIST CSF & ISO/IEC 27001:** Aligning technical controls with global securtiy frameworks.
      * **The CIA Triad:** Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of system resources thruogh proactive defense.
      * **Zero Trust Principles:** Minimizing the attack surface by disabling unnecessary services and restricting permissions.
