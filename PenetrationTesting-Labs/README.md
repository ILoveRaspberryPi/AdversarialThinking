# PenetrationTesting-Labs README
This folder documents my offensive security research and red teaming exercises. 
My goal is to adopt the methodology of Black Hat and Grey Hat hackers to identify system weaknesses, which in turn allows me to build more resilient defenses.

### The Adversarial Mindset
I approach these labs through the lens of an attacker to better understand:
  * **Reconnaissance & Enumeration:** How an adversary identifies and maps a network.
  * **Exploitation:** The specific techniques used to bypass security controls.
  * **Post-Exploitation:** How attackers maintain and move laterally within a system.

### Toward Purple Teaming
By performing these red teaming exercises, I am directly sharpening my Purple Teaming capabilities.
  * **Read Team (offensive):** Thinking like the adversary to find the "holes."
  * **Blue Team (Defensive):** Applying my learnings in GRC and hardening to plug those holes.
  * **The Result:** A comprehensive security posture that is tested, validated, and aligned with industry standards.
