# Governance, Risk, and Compliance
This directory serves as the stragic core of my cybersecurity portfolio. 
It documents my ability to align technical security controls with business objectives, regulatory requirements, and ethical standards.
As I finalize my B.S. in Cybersecurity, this section demonstrates my transition from technical execution to strategic oversight.

### Folder Structure
  * **Governance-and-Policy:** Documentation of the "laws" of the network, including security policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs).
  * **Risk-Management:** Identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies for digital and organizational threats.
  * **Compliance-Frameworks:** Mapping technical implementations to industry standards such as NIST CSF and ISO/IEC 27001.
  * **Legal-and-Ethics:** Exploration of digital privacy, legal evidence handling, and the ethical application of the "Grey Hat" mindset in a professional environment. 

### Strategic Objective
My goal in GRC is to ensure that security is not just a technical barrier, but a business enabler. I focus on:
  * **Transparency:** Creating clear documentation that can be audited and verified.
  * **Resilience:** Building risk-based strategies that allow organizations to recover quickly from incidents.
  * **Integrity:** Ensuring that every technical control serves a specific regulatory or ethical requirement.
