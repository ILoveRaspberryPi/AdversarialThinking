# Psychology and Human Behavior (Risk Analysis)
This directory explores the "Human Element" of the risk landscape. 
By applying behavioral analysis and psychological research, I aim to identify, assess, and mitigate risks that originate from human interaction with digital systems. 
This research is a key component of my broader Risk Management strategy.

### Strategic Objective
To reduce organizational risk by understanding the psychological motivations and behavioral patterns of both external attackers (Social Engineering) and internal users (Insider Threats).

### Key Research Pillars
  * **Social Engineering Vulnerability:** Analyzing how cognitive biases and emotional triggers (such as urgency or fear) are exploited to bypass technical security controls.
  * **Behavioral Pattern Analysis:** Using psychological profiling to identify "red flags" and patterns of deception or manipulation.
  * **Adversarial Psychology:** Adopting a Black Hat/Grey Hat mindset to predict how threat actors think, move, and select their targets.
  * **Insider Threat Mitigation:** Understanding the stressors and psychological factors that lead to accidental or intentional internal security breaches.

### Integration with Risk Assessment
Every finding in this folder is designed to feed back into the Risk Register, ensuring that human-based risks are scored, prioritized, and mitigated with the same rigor as technical vulnerabilities.
