# Risk Management
This directory documents the processes used to identify, assess, and prioritize technical and organizational risks. 
In the GRC framework, risk management ensures that security resources are applied effectively to the most critical threats first.

### Methodology
I approach risk through a structured lifecycle designed to move from reactive "firefighting" to proactive mitigation:
  * **Risk Identification:** Cataloging potential threats to system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  * **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating the likelihood of a threat occuring and the potential impact on operations.
  * **Risk Mitigation:** Implementing technical or administrative controls, such as the hardening steps documented in my Hardening-Labs folder, to reduce risk to an acceptable level.
  * **Risk Monitoring:** Continuously tracking the environment for new vulnerabilities or changes in the threat landscape.

### Key Artifacts
  * **Risk Register:** A comprehensive log of identifiedrisks, their severity, and their current mitigation status.
  * **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Research into how system outages or data breaches affect specific organizational goals.
  * **Threat Modeling:** Using an Adversarial Thinking mindset to predict how an attacker might exploit a specific network or system architectures.

### Standards & Tools
  * **NIST SP 800-30:** Guide for Conductiing Risk Assessments.
  * **ISO/IEC 27005:** Information security risk management standards.
  * **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** Used to provide a standardized score for the severity of technical vulnerabilities.
