# Legal and Ethics
This directory explores the intersection of cybersecurity, law, and ethical responsibilities of a practitioner. In GRC, understanding the legal landscape is as critical as understanding the technical one.

### Purpose
The goal of this section is to document my understanding of the legal frameworks governing digital space and the ethical boundaries that separate Adversarial Thinking from malicious activity. 
I focus on the transition from a "Black Hat" and "Grey Hat" mindset to a professional, ethically-driven defense posture.

### Key Research Areas
  * **Digital Privacy & Privacy Law:** Exploring the legal requirements for data protection and individual privacy rights.
  * **Evidentiary Integrity:** Understanding the legal standards for handling digital evidence, crucial for incident response and legal proceedings.
