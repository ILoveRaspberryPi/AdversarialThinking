# Compliance Frameworks
This directory serves as the validation layer of my GRC portfolio. It documents the mapping of technical security controls to regulatory requirements and industry-standard frameworks, ensuring that all defensive measures are measurable, auditable, and compliant.

### Methodology
I treat compliance as a continuous process rather than a one-time event. My approach involves:
  * **Control Mapping:** Linking specific technical configurations (e.g., kernel hardening) to specific framework requirements.
  * **Gap Analysis:** Identifying discrepancies between current system states and desired compliance postures.
  * **Audit Readiness:** Maintaining clear documentation and "artifacts" (logs, screenshots, configs) to prove that security controls are functioning as intended.

### Key Frameworks
I focus on the implementation and auditing of the following standards:
  * **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** Utilizing the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions to guide security strategy.
  * **CIS Critical Security Controls:** Implementing high-priority technical "Best Practices" for immediate risk reduction.
  * **HIPAA/PCI-DSS:** Exploring industry-specific regulations for healthcare and financial data.

### Artifacts
  * **Compliance Crosswalks:** Tables that demonstrate how one technical action satisfies multiple regulatory requirements.
  * **Audit Logs:** Documented evidence of system hardening and policy enforcement.
  * **Self-Assessments:** Periodic reviews of the AdversarialThinking repsoitory's assets against established benchmarks.
