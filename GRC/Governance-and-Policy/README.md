# Governance and Policy
This directory focuses on the "Administrative Controls" layer of cybersecurty. 
I document the development of high-level policies, standards, and procedures that govern how an organization protects its assets and manages its human and technical resources.

### Purpose
The goal of this section is to demonstrate my proficiency in creating a structured securtiy posture that is consistent, enforceable, and aligned with organizational goals.
By establishing clear governance, I ensure that technical labs (like those in my Hardening-Labs folder) are not just isolated tasks, but part of a larger, unified security strategy.

### Key Documentation Areas
  * **Security Policies:** High-level statements of intent, such as Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) and Information Security Policies.
  * **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Step-by-step instructions for routine security tasks to ensure consistency and minimize human error.
  * **Standards and Guidelines:** Specific technical requirements that provide a baseline for system configurations and user behavior.

### Framework Alignment
Every policy drafted in this folder is built with reference to:
  * **NIST SP 800-53:** For security and privacy controls for federal information systems.
  * **ISO/IEC 27001:** For establishing, implementing, and maintaining an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
  * **CIS Benchmarks:** For industry-standard technical hardening guidelines.
